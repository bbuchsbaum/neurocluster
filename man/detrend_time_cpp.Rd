\title{Detrend Voxel Timeseries (Fast C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
detrend_time_cpp(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix with voxels as rows and timepoints as columns}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with linear trend removed from each row (voxel)
}
\description{
Removes linear trend from each voxel's timeseries using fast
parallel linear regression.
}
\details{
For each voxel, fits a linear model y = intercept + slope * t and
subtracts the fitted values: residuals = y - fitted.

Uses RcppParallel for fast parallel computation across voxels.
The linear regression is computed efficiently using precomputed
time statistics.
