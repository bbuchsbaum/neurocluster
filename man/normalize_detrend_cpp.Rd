\title{Normalize Volumes and Detrend Timeseries (Fast C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
normalize_detrend_cpp(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix with voxels as rows and timepoints as columns}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with volume offsets and linear trends removed
}
\description{
Combined operation: first removes volume mean offsets, then removes
linear trend from each voxel's timeseries. More efficient than
calling both functions separately.
}
\details{
Performs two operations in a single parallel pass:
\enumerate{
\item Centers each volume to zero mean
\item Removes linear trend from each voxel's (now centered) timeseries
}
}
