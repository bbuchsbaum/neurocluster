\title{Flexible Detrending with Basis Functions (Fast C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
detrend_basis_cpp(data, basis)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix with voxels as rows and timepoints as columns}

\item{basis}{Orthonormal basis matrix (n_time x n_basis) to project out.
Use make_dct_basis() or make_poly_basis() to generate.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with basis components removed from each row
}
\description{
Removes trends from each voxel's timeseries by projecting out a basis.
Supports polynomial or DCT (discrete cosine transform) basis functions.
}
\details{
For orthonormal basis B, computes residuals as:
y_detrend = y - B * (B^T * y)

This is equivalent to regressing out the basis and keeping residuals.
