\title{Compute Clustering Accuracy Metrics}
\usage{
clustering_accuracy(predicted, truth)
}
\arguments{
\item{predicted}{Integer vector of predicted cluster assignments}

\item{truth}{Integer vector of ground truth cluster assignments}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{ari}{Adjusted Rand Index (-1 to 1, 1 = perfect)}
\item{nmi}{Normalized Mutual Information (0 to 1, 1 = perfect)}
\item{accuracy}{Best accuracy after optimal label matching (0 to 1)}
\item{n_predicted}{Number of unique predicted clusters}
\item{n_truth}{Number of unique ground truth clusters}
\item{perfect}{Logical: TRUE if clustering is perfect (ARI = 1)}
}
\description{
Compares predicted cluster assignments against ground truth using multiple
metrics that are invariant to cluster label permutation.
}
\details{
Three complementary metrics are computed:

\strong{Adjusted Rand Index (ARI):}
Measures agreement between two clusterings, adjusted for chance.
ARI = 1 means perfect agreement, ARI = 0 means random, ARI < 0 means
worse than random.

\strong{Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):}
Information-theoretic measure of clustering similarity.
NMI = 1 means perfect agreement, NMI = 0 means independent.

\strong{Accuracy:}
Fraction of correctly assigned voxels after finding optimal
correspondence between predicted and true labels using the
Hungarian algorithm.

\examples{
# Perfect clustering
truth <- rep(1:3, each = 10)
pred <- rep(c(2, 3, 1), each = 10)  # Same clustering, different labels
clustering_accuracy(pred, truth)  # ARI = 1

}
