\title{Prune 1-NN edges to achieve target number of components}
\usage{
prune_edges_for_k_cpp(n_nodes, nearest_neighbor, distances, target_k)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_nodes}{Number of nodes}

\item{nearest_neighbor}{IntegerVector of nearest neighbor for each node (0-based)}

\item{distances}{NumericVector of distances to nearest neighbors}

\item{target_k}{Target number of components}
}
\value{
IntegerVector of pruned nearest neighbors (-1 for pruned edges)
}
\description{
Sorts 1-NN edges by distance and adds them incrementally until K components remain.
Used for exact-K stopping condition.
