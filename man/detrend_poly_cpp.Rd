\title{Polynomial Detrending (Convenience Function)}
\usage{
detrend_poly_cpp(data, degree = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix with voxels as rows and timepoints as columns}

\item{degree}{Polynomial degree (0 = mean, 1 = linear, 2 = quadratic, etc.)}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with polynomial trend removed
}
\description{
Removes polynomial trend up to specified degree from each voxel.
}
\details{
Convenience wrapper that generates polynomial basis and calls detrend_basis_cpp.
For degree=1, this is equivalent to detrend_time_cpp but slightly slower.
