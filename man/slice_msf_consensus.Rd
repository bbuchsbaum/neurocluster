\usage{
slice_msf_consensus(
  run_results,
  mask,
  nbhd = 8,
  k_fuse = 0.3,
  min_size_fuse = 80,
  use_features = FALSE,
  lambda = 0.7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{run_results}{List of results from \code{slice_msf_single}, each containing
labels, weights, and sketch matrices.}

\item{mask}{A \code{NeuroVol} mask used in the original segmentation.}

\item{nbhd}{Neighborhood connectivity (4, 6, or 8). Should match the value used
in the original segmentation. Default is 8.}

\item{k_fuse}{Scale parameter for consensus fusion graph (0-2). Lower values create
more refined clusters during fusion. If too low, may fragment consensus clusters.
Default is 0.30.}

\item{min_size_fuse}{Minimum cluster size during fusion. Can be set lower than
the original min_size to preserve small but consistent clusters. Default is 80.}

\item{use_features}{Include feature similarity in consensus fusion. When TRUE,
uses both label co-occurrence and temporal similarity from DCT sketches. This
can improve cross-slice consistency and is recommended when targeting exact K.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{lambda}{Mixing parameter (0-1) controlling the balance between label agreement
and feature similarity when use_features=TRUE. Higher values (0.7-0.9) emphasize
label agreement, lower values (0.3-0.6) emphasize features. Default is 0.7.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{labels}{Integer vector of consensus cluster labels}
\item{params}{List of parameters used in consensus fusion}
}
}
\description{
Combines multiple SLiCE-MSF segmentation runs using consensus clustering to improve
stability and reduce variability. This function can help reduce z-plane artifacts
by averaging cluster assignments across multiple independent runs.
}
\details{
Consensus fusion works by building a co-association matrix that counts how often
each pair of voxels is assigned to the same cluster across runs. This matrix is
then used as edge weights in a new graph segmentation. When use_features=TRUE,
the edge weights also incorporate the similarity of DCT sketches, providing
additional stability.

For reducing z-artifacts, using use_features=TRUE with lambda around 0.5-0.6 can
help ensure that clusters are consistent both in terms of their boundaries and
their temporal characteristics.
