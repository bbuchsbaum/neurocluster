\title{Normalize Volumes by Removing Mean Offset (Fast C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
normalize_volumes_cpp(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix with voxels as rows and timepoints as columns}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with each column (volume) centered to mean zero
}
\description{
Removes the mean offset from each volume/timepoint in a matrix.
This centers each volume to have zero mean across voxels.
}
\details{
For each timepoint t, computes mean_t = mean(data\link{,t}) and subtracts
it from all voxels: output\link{,t} = data\link{,t} - mean_t

Uses RcppParallel for fast parallel computation across voxels.
