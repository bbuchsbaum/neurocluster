\title{DCT Detrending (Convenience Function)}
\usage{
detrend_dct_cpp(data, n_basis = 4L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric matrix with voxels as rows and timepoints as columns}

\item{n_basis}{Number of DCT basis functions to remove (including constant).
Default 4 removes constant, linear, and first two cosine harmonics.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with low-frequency components removed
}
\description{
Removes low-frequency components using discrete cosine transform.
}
\details{
DCT detrending is commonly used in fMRI preprocessing. The number of
basis functions controls the high-pass filter cutoff:
\itemize{
\item n_basis = 1: mean removal only
\item n_basis = 2: ~ linear detrend
\item n_basis = 4-6: typical for fMRI (removes drift < ~0.01 Hz for TR=2s)
}

Higher n_basis = more aggressive high-pass filtering.
